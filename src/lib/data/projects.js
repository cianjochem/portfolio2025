		title: 'Suffocating Waters',
		year: 2020,
		type: ['Data Visualization', 'Print'],
		slug: 'suffocating-waters',
		description: `Fertilizer run-off from industrial agriculture is choking the planet’s oceans, rivers and lakes. Nitrogen and phosphorus pollution feed explosive algal blooms that suck the oxygen from the water as they grow. These algal blooms result in dead zones that pose an ever-increasing threat to marine life as their habitats disappear.

The publication ›Suffocating Waters‹ aims to draw the reader's attention to this issue through tailored infographics and map materials. The specially developed imagery shows the processes on a narrative level and supports the text. The maps provide quantitative information and are intended to encourage readers to conduct their investigations into the correlations between nitrate levels and declining oxygen levels.`,

		title: 'Gässli Film Festival',
		year: 2018,

		slug: 'gaessli-film-festival',
		description: `The ›Gässli Film Festival‹ is a short film festival held annually in the ›Gerbergässlein‹ in Basel. As a non-profit event in the Basel region, it conveys cinematic fascination and backgrounds on filmmaking.\n\n		The Festival should be communicated through a keyvisual, which works as a poster and as moving media in the form of a teaser. The keyvisual is based on typographic experiments with a tube screen in 4:3 format. This resulted in moving typographic compositions, which should remind the viewer of the nostalgia in the filmmaking of the 80s.`,

		description: `The ›Posterslam‹ is a platform to experiment with poster design on a given theme and discuss the result over a beer. The topic of the 16th ›Posterslam‹ dealt with the organic architecture of the US-American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. The poster references the ›Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum‹ in New York City. The 3D rendering and typographic composition create a contrast between the organic and the spatial.`,
